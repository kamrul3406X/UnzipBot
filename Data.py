**What are Modes ‚ùî**

1) **Tortoise üê¢**
Bit Slow but Steady. 

While using this mode you will can be notified about the all progresses happening.

Progresses include:
- downloaded so far
- contents in provided file
- number of files in provided file
- uploaded too far with number of the file being uploaded

It doesn't take too much time than other mode and is the recommended method. 

2) ** Rabbit üêá**
Bit Fast but less user friendly.

While using this mode you won't be notified about any progresses that go on. Just download completion and upload completion will be notified. 

This is bit fast but only recommended for larger files as smaller files won't have much time difference.
